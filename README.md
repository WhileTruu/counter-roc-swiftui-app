# Counter!

A simple Roc counter app on a Swift platform, rendered with SwiftUI.

![counter app](https://github.com/WhileTruu/counter-roc-swiftui-app/raw/main/counter.gif)

Running for development: `roc dev`.

Building the app: `./run.sh` - however, it seems that the script does not always
change inside the created `SwiftUIDemo.app` folder, even if deleted.
I have no idea what that is about.
